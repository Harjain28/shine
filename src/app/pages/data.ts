          Question:
            "How do I pick between a Secured and an Unsecured Business Loan?",
          Answer:
            "The first question you need to answer is whether you have or even want to mortgage collateral for the loan. If you have collateral, then we recommend applying for a Secured Business Loan for better loan terms. If you don’t have collateral, then an Unsecured business loan is the quickest and easiest way to get business funding!",
        },
        {
          Question: "Who can use CreditEnable to get an Unsecured Business Loan?",
          Answer:
            "If you're over 21 years old, your enterprise is registered with a business vintage of at least 2 years, and your annual turnover is at least ₹12 lakh, then you should be eligible to apply for an Unsecured Business Loan via CreditEnable.",
        },
        {
          Question:
            "How do I decide what type of Unsecured Business Loan is right for me?",
          Answer:
            "There are different types of unsecured business loans designed for different business expenses. The smartest way to decide is knowing what you want to use the loan for or by getting in touch with our Credit Experts, who can help you find the right loan product and support you throughout the loan process to ensure you get the best unsecured business loan terms possible!",
        },
        {
          Question:
            "Does CreditEnable check my Credit Report when I apply for an Unsecured Business Loan?",
          Answer:
            "Yes, we do a soft pull of your Experian Credit Report when checking your eligibility for unsecured business financing. This credit check is free and has zero impact on your credit score. We also send you a copy of your report, so you know the health of your credit history. Your credit score is important when you apply for business funding for your business and impacts the Unsecured Business Loan interest rate and terms the lenders offer you.",
        },
        {
          Question:
            "Why should I use CreditEnable to apply for an Unsecured Business Loan?",
          Answer:
            "While Unsecured Business Loans are more convenient than Secured Business Loans and require lesser documentation, the application process can be just as confusing. That’s where we come in. We'll do the heavy-lifting to match you with the right lenders and negotiate the best deal for you based on your profile. We’ve already partnered with 30+ lenders so 1 application with us gives you access to all of them! We’ll help you work smart and make your dreams come true faster!",

            "How do I decide if I should apply for a Gold Loan or a Business Loan?",
          Answer:
            "When deciding between a gold loan and a business loan, consider factors such as your immediate funding needs, the value and availability of gold assets, repayment terms, the business and gold loan interest rates, and the specific requirements and benefits of each loan option. Gold loan interest rates are usually lower than those of business loans, and require less documentation. You can also pay them back faster than business loans without much difficulty.",

You can use this funding for personal or business financing, and the value of the gold loan the lender approves for you, along with the gold loan interest rate they offer will be dependent on the value of the gold you own.",

In the case of a Gold Loan, the Gold Loan interest rate the lender offers you is based on the market value of the gold ornaments you use as collateral.",

          Question:
            "How do I pick between an Unsecured and a Secured Term Loan?",
          Answer:
            "Choosing between an unsecured and a secured term loan for your business depends on various factors. Consider your risk tolerance, creditworthiness, loan amount needed, and collateral available. Unsecured Business Loans are faster but have higher interest rates, while Secured Term Loans offer lower rates but require collateral. Evaluate your business's specific needs and financial situation to make an informed decision.",

          Question: "Who can use CreditEnable to get a Secured Term Loan?",
          Answer:
            "If you're over 23 years old, your business is registered with a business vintage of at least 3 years, and your minimum annual turnover is ₹12 lakh, then you should be eligible to apply for a Secured Term Loan via CreditEnable.",

        {
          Question:
            "How do I decide what Secured Term Loan tenure is right for me?",
          Answer:
            "When determining the right tenure for a Secured Term Loan for your business, assess your business's cash flow and repayment capacity. Consider whether your current cash flow can balance a shorter tenure for faster repayment and reduced interest costs, or a longer tenure for lower EMIs. We recommend aligning the loan repayment period with your business goals and financial stability to make an informed decision.",

        {
          Question:

The more communicative and transparent you are with the lender, the more likely they are to work with you to find a solution in the case of a Machinery Loan default.",

            "You should apply for a Loan Against Property if you are a business in need of significant funds for long-term investments like business expansion, debt consolidation, or working capital requirements. It is your best choice if you have substantial property equity and the ability to manage the repayment obligations effectively.",

          Answer:
            "If you're over 23 years old, your enterprise is registered with a business vintage of at least 3 years, and your annual turnover is at least ₹12 lakh, then you should be eligible to apply for Loan Against Property via CreditEnable.",

          Question:
            "Can I continue using my property if I used it as collateral for my Loan Against Property?",

            "Yes, you can typically continue using your property even after using it as collateral for a Loan Against Property. The lender places a lien on the mortgaged property, granting them the right to seize and sell it if you default on the business loan, but you retain ownership and can continue using it as long as the loan repayments are made as per the repayment schedule.",

          Question:
            "How do I pick between a Secured and an Unsecured Term Business Loan?",
          Answer:
            " The easiest way to choose between an Unsecured Term Loan and a Secured Term Loan is whether you own assets that you can mortgage to get the business loan. Unsecured Term Loans are collateral-free though you do need to have a decent credit score to be eligible for one.",

        {
          Question: "Who can use CreditEnable to get an Unsecured Term Loan?",
          Answer:
            "If you're over 23 years old, your enterprise is registered with a business vintage of at least 2 years, and your annual turnover is at least ₹12 lakh, then you should be eligible to apply for an Unsecured Term Loan via CreditEnable.",
        },
        {
          Question:
            "How do I decide what unsecured term loan tenure is right for me?",
          Answer:
            "The tenure of your loan depends on what you want to use the loan for. If you’re looking for a term loan to help your business through a cash lean period, then a short term unsecured loan works. On the other hand, if you want to expand your services or invest in new inventory, the return on invest is slightly longer and a long term unsecured loan may be better for that purpose. Our Credit Experts can help you determine what loan tenure works for your business when you apply for a business loan with us.",
        },
        {
          Question:
            "Does CreditEnable check my Credit Report when I apply for an Unsecured Term Loan?",

            "Yes, we do a soft pull of your Experian Credit Report when checking your eligibility for unsecured term loan, regardless of whether you’re applying for a long term unsecured loan or a short term unsecured loan. This credit check is free, has absolutely no impact on your score, and we even send you a copy of your report, so you know how healthy your credit is.",

            "Does CreditEnable check my Credit Report when I apply for Line of Credit loan?",
          Answer:
            "Yes, we do a soft pull of your Experian Credit Report when checking your eligibility for a business Line of Credit loan.
